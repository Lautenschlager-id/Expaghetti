**The library `expaghetti` is under heavy development.**

It aims towards allowing Lua developers to use (bizarre) Regular Expressions without the need of bothering in using thousands of matches with patterns or even lpeg.

Feel free to open a new issue _for bug reports, code and solution enhancements, ideas or kind comments_, or pull requests if you can understand _the spaghetti_!
