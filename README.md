**The library `expaghetti` is under heavy development.**

It aims towards allowing Lua developers to use (bizarre) Regular Expressions without the need of bothering in using thousands of matches with patterns or even lpeg.

It currently works on any Lua 5.x version, and is intended to be released with such support.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Lautenschlager-id/expaghetti/wiki) to learn more about the syntax used in expaghetti.
