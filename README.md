The library `expaghetti` is under heavy development.

It aims towards allowing Lua developers to use Regular Expressions without the need of bothering in using thousands of matches with patterns or even lpeg.<br>
It currently works on Lua 5.2 and 5.3, a bitwise wrapper might be needed for 5.1 support.
